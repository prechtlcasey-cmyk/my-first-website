<p> It might seem crazy what I am 'bout to say
Sunshine, she's here you can take a break
I'ma hot air balloon that could go to space, huh
With the air, like I don't care, baby, by the way, huh
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
(Because I'm happy)
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
(Because I'm happy)
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
(Because I'm happy)
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do
Here come bad news, talking this and that (talk, yeah)
Well, give me all you got and don't hold back (yeah)
Well, I should probably warn you, I'll be just fine (yeah)
No offense to you, don't waste your time, here's why
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
(Because I'm happy)
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
(Because I'm happy)
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
(Because I'm happy)
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do (hey, c'mon, uh)
bring me down, can't nothin'
(Happy) bring me down, my level's too high
(Happy) to bring me down, can't nothin' (huh)
(Happy) bring me down, I said (let me tell you now), uh
can't nothin', uh
(Happy, happy), bring me down (happy, happy), my level's too high
(Happy, happy) to bring me down (happy, happy), can't nothin'
(Happy, happy) bring me down, I said
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
(Because I'm happy)
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
(Because I'm happy)
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
(Because I'm happy)
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
(Because I'm happy)
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
(Because I'm happy)
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
(Because I'm happy)
Clap along if you feel like (uh) that's what you wanna do (hey, c'mon, uh)
, can't nothin'
(Happy, happy) uh, bring me down (happy, happy) my level's too high
(Happy, happy) to bring me down (happy, happy), can't nothin'
(Happy, happy) bring me down, I said
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
(Because I'm happy)
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
(Because I'm happy)
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you, ay, ay, ay
(Because I'm happy)
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
(Because I'm happy)
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
(Because I'm happy)
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you (hey)
(Because I'm happy)
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do
Huh-huh, come on</p>
